To get a better understanding of how to leverage Machine Learning capabilities on {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, we have provided detailed examples as part of this documentation. Each example covers a use case and walks you through the entire machine learning lifecycle from data ingestion, model training/evaluation to model deployment and inferencing.

| Use case  | Description |
| -----     | -----       |
| [Demand Forecasting](/machine-learning/demand-forecasting/) | Forecast the peak/non-peak hours of water consumption using a Time Series model |
| [Activity Recognition](/machine-learning/activity-recognition/) | Predict human activities - sitting, running or jumping - based on sensor data from a mobile device |
| [Anomaly Detection](/machine-learning/anomaly-detection/) | Detect anomalous events through the sensor data of a mobile device |
| [Casting Defect Detection](/machine-learning/casting-defect-detection/) | Identify defects in metal casting process by leveraging deep learning algorithms |
| [Welding Defect Detection](/machine-learning/welding-defect-detection/) | Identify defects in industrial welding by leveraging deep learning algorithms |
| [Remaining Useful Life Estimates](/machine-learning/remaining-useful-life/) | Identify remaining useful life of equipment by leveraging deep learning algorithms |
