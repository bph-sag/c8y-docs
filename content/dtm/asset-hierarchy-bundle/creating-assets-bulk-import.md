<b>Example:</b><br>
For an asset called "Room1" in the hierarchy "Building > Floor > Room" the path value is "Building 1/Floor 1", where "Building 1" and "Floor 1" represent the respective asset types.</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Mandatory (for child assets)</td>

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
Modify the excel settings to provide the date in a YYYY-MM-DD format. This prevents an auto-correct of the date on input.
{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

To provide a file input as a custom property value, the file must first be uploaded to a {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant using the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} API.

Refer to the [Binaries API](https://{{< domain-c8y >}}/api/core/{{< c8y-current-version >}}/#operation/postBinariesCollectionResource) in the {{< openapi >}} for details on how to upload a file to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.

The binary ID in the API response must be provided as input for the custom property field with type "file" in the CSV template.

If the type is "Boolean", the input field must be either "true" or "false".
If the type is "enumeration", then the input field must be in the list of values specified during creation of the custom property.
If the type is "text" or "number" and custom criteria were provided during custom property creation, then the input value in CSV template must fulfill all the custom property criteria.

Fill in details for all the assets which must be created as part of the asset hierarchy.

Start with the asset details for root asset type.
Then enter the asset details for child asset types under the root asset.
Next, enter the details for the next level in the hierarchy of child assets and repeat until the details for all the assets are entered in the CSV template.
Save the CSV template in your system.

### To upload a CSV template

To upload the CSV template follow the steps below:

1. Click **Import assets** in the **Assets** page.

2. Select the asset type in the **Import assets** dialog.

3. Upload the previously filled and saved CSV template in the **Drop file here** section.

4. If all the inputs are provided correctly, the bulk import is successful, resulting in a success notification. The asset hierarchy and its assets are created successfully.

5. View the newly created assets in the **Assets** page.

If the inputs are not provided in the correct format, the bulk import fails with validation errors, resulting in a **Failed asset imports** notification, showing the issue types, for example, an invalid template or an incorrect asset hierarchy.
No assets are created.

If the bulk import fails, review the reported issues and try again.

### Partial import

If the asset hierarchy already exists, and you want to import more assets, it can be achieved by a partial import.

To import a single child asset or the child asset hierarchy:

1. Navigate to the child asset page and download the template using **Import assets**.

2. Fill in the details for the child asset hierarchy in the CSV template. See [CSV template parameters](#csv-template-parameters) for more details.

	{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
From any hierarchy level, the template will be downloaded only for its child hierarchy.
Assets must only be imported for the child hierarchy.
	{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

3. Enter the details for the child assets in the CSV template.

4. Click **Import assets**.

5. Upload the CSV template in the **Drop file here** section in the **Import assets** dialog.

If all details are mentioned correctly in the CSV template, the child asset hierarchy is created successfully.

An unsuccessful partial import will result in a **Failed asset imports** notification, showing the validation issues.
Review the reported issuels and try again.
