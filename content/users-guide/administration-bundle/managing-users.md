    content: "The Cumulocity IoT user management allows you to manage the users within your tenant. You can create new users, assign usernames and passwords, store user details, or configure the login and security options.  


    Moreover you can select the global roles for a user, see also *Administration > Managing permissions* in the *User guide*."
---

The user management feature allows you to manage the users within your tenant. With this functionality you may:

- Create users.
- Assign usernames and set passwords.
- Store user details.
- Specify login options.
- Enable additional login security by using Two-Factor Authentication (TFA).

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The user needs to have a role with the user management permission ADMIN or CREATE to be able to do so.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

If your tenant is configured for using single sign-on (SSO) in {{< sag-cloud >}}, new users should be created under **My Cloud**, accessible through the application switcher in the upper right corner, so that they are able to use the single sign-on feature.

For users created via an external authorization server, updating the following settings in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} will have no effect (will be reset on the next user re-login):

* user info (login alias, email, first name, last name, telephone)
* global roles - configurable via SSO access mapping
* application access - configurable via SSO access mapping

Moreover, password reset in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} is disabled for users created through an external authentication server.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
Users which are using single sign-on cannot change the password of users which are managed by the platform.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

### Viewing users

To view all users in your tenant, click **Users** in the **Account** menu in the navigator.

![Expanded view](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-users-list.png)

A user list will be displayed, providing the following information for each user:

* The username that is used to access the tenant.
* The name and email of the user (if set).
* The global roles assigned to the user.
* The [strength](/users-guide/getting-started/#change-password) of the password set for the user

To filter the list by username, you can use the filter field at the left of the top menu bar. With the dropdown list you can filter by global roles. For details on filtering, see [Getting started > UI functionalities and features > Filtering](/users-guide/getting-started/#filtering).

In order to apply the selected filters click **Apply**.

Initially, the **User** page only shows the top-level users. To see all users in your account at once, click **Expand all** at the right of the top bar. This will expand all top-level users, showing their sub-users. Click **Collapse all** to just show the top-level users again. For details on user hierarchies, refer to [Managing user hierarchies](/users-guide/enterprise-tenant/#user-hierarchies).

### To add a user

1. Click **Add user** at the right of the top menu bar.  
  {{< c8y-admon-info >}}
If single sign-on is enabled for your tenant, a message will show up which reminds you that you are about to create a local user which will not be able to login via single sign-on. Create new users in **My Cloud** instead, accessible through the application switcher in the upper right corner, to enable them using the single sign-on feature.
  {{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

2. At the left of the **New user** window, provide the following information to identify the user:

	<table>
