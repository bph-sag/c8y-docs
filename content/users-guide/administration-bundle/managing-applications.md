The {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform distinguishes between applications and microservices, see also [Developing applications](/concepts/applications) in the *Concepts guide*.

* [Applications](#applications) -  all web applications either subscribed to the tenant or owned by the tenant.

* [Microservices](#managing-microservices) - server-side applications used to develop further functionality on top of {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.

Both can be accessed via the **Ecosystem** menu in the navigator.

Additionally, in {{< enterprise-tenant >}}s, it is possible to configure **Default subscriptions**, that means you can specify a list of applications that are subscribed by default to every new tenant on creation and/or to all existing tenants on platform upgrade. For details, see [Enterprise tenant > Default subscriptions](/users-guide/enterprise-tenant/#default-subscriptions).

### Applications

Click **Applications** in the **Ecosystem** menu in the navigator to display a list or grid of all applications in your account.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-all-applications.png" alt="All applications" style="max-width: 100%">

In the **All applications** tab, you can see all applications available in your tenant. There are two kinds of applications:

- [Subscribed applications](#subscribed-applications) - applications subscribed to the tenant, either provided by the platform (as default applications) or a service provider.
- [Custom applications](#own-applications) - applications owned by the tenant. You can [add custom applications](#adding-applications) in various ways as own applications.

Your applications are available through the application switcher in the top bar.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-app-switcher.png" alt="App switcher">


<a name="subscribed-applications"></a>
### Subscribed applications

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} provides a variety of applications for different purposes. Depending on your installation and/or optional services your tenant will show a selection of the potentially available applications.

Below all applications are listed which are by default available in the {{< standard-tenant >}} or {{< enterprise-tenant >}}. In addition, numerous optional applications might be subscribed to your tenant.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
In the **All applications** tab, subscribed applications are labeled as "Subscribed". Subscribed applications may not be added, modified or removed by the user but only by a tenant administrator.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

### Custom applications

Custom applications may be:

* Web-based UI applications, either deployed as standalone applications or as plugins deployed into a specific application (for example, a widget to the Cockpit dashboard).
* Links to an application running elsewhere.
* Duplicates of subscribed applications (in order to be able to customize them).

In the **All applications** tab, custom applications are labeled as "Custom".  

<a name="adding-applications"></a>
#### To add a custom application

Click **Add application** at the top right of the **All applications** tab.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-application-add.png" alt="Add application methods">

In the resulting dialog box, select one of the following methods:

* [Upload web application](#uploading-zip-files) - drop a ZIP file or browse for it in your file system.
* [External application](#external-application) - link to an application running elsewhere.
* [Install from available packages](#blueprint-application) - select a package blueprint.
* [Duplicate existing application](#clone-application) - create a copy of an existing application.

<a name="uploading-zip-files"></a>
##### To upload a web application

1. Click **Add application** at the top right of the **All applications** tab.
2. Select **Upload web application**.
3. In the resulting dialog box, drop a ZIP file or browse for it in your file system.

The application is created once the ZIP file has been successfully uploaded.

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
The ZIP file must contain the *index.html* and *cumulocity.json* in its root directory, otherwise the application will not work.
{{< /c8y-admon-important >}}

<a name="external-application"></a>
##### To link to an external application

1. Click **Add application** at the top right of the **All applications** tab.

<a name="clone-application"></a>
##### To duplicate an application

Duplicating an application might be useful if you want to customize a subscribed application according to your needs. Duplicating a subscribed application creates a copy of the application as an own application, with a link to the original application.

1. Click **Add application** at the top right of the **All applications** tab.
2. In the upcoming dialog, select **Duplicate existing application**.
3. Select the desired application from the dropdown list, for example "Cockpit".
4. In the next window, provide a name for the application, an application key to identify the application, and a path as part of the URL to invoke the application. Per default, the values of the original application are provided, extended by a number. If you set the path to the path of the original subscribed application, your own application will overrule the subscribed application.
<br><br>
<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-application-duplicate-2.png" alt="Duplicate application">
<br><br>
    {{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The platform restricts the use of the prefix "feature-" in the **Name** field. You cannot create applications using this prefix in the application name. This also applies to existing applications in cases where the duplicate application feature is used.
    {{< /c8y-admon-info >}}
5. Finally, click **Duplicate** to create the application.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
In case the application has been subscribed to the tenant, there is an additional toggle **Overrule subscribed application**. If you turn this toggle on, the values for name, key and path will be inherited from the original application and your duplicated application will overrule the subscribed application. Turn it off, to modify the values.<br><br><img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-application-duplicate-3.png" alt="Duplicate application">
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

For details on the fields, see also [Application properties](#application-properties) below.

<a name="application-properties"></a>
### Application properties

To display further details on an application, click it to open its **Properties** tab.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-application-properties.png" alt="Application properties" style="max-width: 100%">

In the **Properties** tab, each application will show the following information, depending on the application type (hosted or external):

### Application plugins

Switch to the **Plugins** tab to view all plugins installed on an application. Plugins can be used to extend existing applications without the need of re-building the application.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-application-plugins-grid.png" alt="Plugins grid" style="max-width: 100%">

In the **Plugins** tab you can add and remove plugins. Additionally, you can install plugins to an application.

<a name="editing-and-removing"></a>
### To edit an application

Simply click the application or click the menu icon at the right of an entry and then click **Edit**.

In the **Properties** tab, several fields can be modified, depending on the application type (see [Application properties](#application-properties)).

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
Never change the system application names (such as "Device Management", "Cockpit"). Otherwise, tenant initialization will fail.
{{< /c8y-admon-important >}}

### To delete an application

Click the menu icon at the right of an entry and then click **Delete**.

If you delete an application that overwrites a subscribed application, the currently subscribed application becomes available to all users. Additionally, the users will then also benefit from future upgrades of the subscribed application.

It is not possible to delete subscribed applications. This can only be done by the owner of the subscribed application.

### Uploading archives

For custom applications, multiple file versions can be stored in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} when they were created by uploading either a ZIP file or a MON file. Each version is called an archive. You can upload different versions at the same time and switch between these versions.

#### To upload an archive

1. Open the application properties for the respective application by clicking on it.
2. Click the plus button at the bottom of the **Activity log** section and browse for the archive in your file system or simply drop the archive file.
3. Click **Upload** to upload the archive to your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} account.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-application-archive.png" alt="Application archive">

Once uploaded, the recently uploaded version is automatically the active version, that is the version of the application that is currently being served to the users of your account. This version cannot be deleted.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The archive functionality is not available for subscribed applications, as only the owner of the application can perform these actions.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

#### To restore an older application version

Users can restore previous versions of an application from an archive.

1. Open the application properties for the respective application by clicking on it.
2. In the **Activity log** section, open the context menu for the desired version by clicking the menu icon and select **Set as active** to make it the active version.

#### To reactivate a single application

If a hosted application is not deployed correctly, users may reactivate it.

1. Open the application properties for the respective application by clicking on it.
3. In the **Activity log** section, open the context menu for the desired version by clicking the menu icon and select **Reactivate**.

The selected application will be reactivated by removing the respective files from the application directory and unpacking the host application package again.

### Packages

Packages are combinations of plugins and blueprints which can be packed together into a single file and then be deployed to the platform. Thus, packages offer better shareability and reusability of UI features across different applications and allow to add UI features to applications without coding knowledge.

Packages can contain two types of applications:

- [**Plugins**](#application-plugins) can be used to extend existing applications without the need of re-building the application.
- **Blueprints** are combinations of multiple UI functionalities which can be hosted by the platform and can be used to create a new application from scratch.

Packages can be located on the **Packages** tab in the **Applications** page.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-application-packages.png" alt="Packages view">

To add a new package click **Add package** at the top right.

By clicking on a package, you can see the package details such as **Package overview** which includes a description and images as well as some meta information which is taken from the *package.json*.

Additionally, it is possible to view all available plugins within the selected package at the right. To install a plugin click **Install plugin** and select the desired application.  

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-application-packages-info.png" alt="Packages overview">

In the **Archives** tab, you see all previously uploaded binaries related to the current package. The binaries displayed on this tab can be downloaded via the context menu next to each archive.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-application-packages-archives.png" alt="Archive view">

In the **Versions** tab of a package, you can select or upload different versions. Versions indicate the state of the package. They can be used to verify whether a certain package is outdated and needs to be updated. By clicking on a version additional information is provided such as package contents, applications or plugins. Tags can be used to give versions meaningful names. The "latest" tag is used to indicate the default version which will be selected in case no tag is provided. The "latest" tag is set by default to the latest version whenever a version is uploaded without a given tag.

To switch to a different version open the context menu for the desired version and click **Set as latest**. To delete a version click **Delete**.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-application-packages-versions.png" alt="Archive view">

### Features

Features are applications which are built-in and not represented by an explicit artifact (like microservices or web applications).

In the **Features** tab, you will find a list of all features subscribed in your tenant. In an {{< enterprise-tenant >}}, the following features are available by default:

<table>
