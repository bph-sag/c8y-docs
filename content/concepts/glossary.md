<a name="tenant"></a>
### Tenant
Tenants are physically separated data spaces with a separate URL, which has a specific set of users, a separate application management and no data sharing by default. Users in a single tenant share the same URL and the same data space.

See also [Tenant hierarchy](#tnt-hierarchy).

<a name="tenant-domain"></a>
### Tenant domain
A key feature of the Enterprise tenant is the ability to operate the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform using a custom domain name. This means that you can configure the platform to serve you and your customers using a host name of choice.

For details see [{{< enterprise-tenant >}} > Customizing your platform](/users-guide/enterprise-tenant/#customization) in the *User guide*.

<a name="tnt-hierarchy"></a>
### Tenant hierarchy
The {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant concept builds a 3-level hierarchy, including the following levels from bottom to top:

  * [{{< standard-tenant >}}](#standard-tenant)
  * [{{< enterprise-tenant >}}](#ent-tenant)
  * [{{< management-tenant >}}](#mgm-tenant)

These three levels differ in their scope, particularly with regards to administration.
